This project is to show the correlation between SAT' score results and race, gender, location, safetiness, etc.
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.
